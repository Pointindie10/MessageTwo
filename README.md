Android App for sending video and images, only have access to the file for 10 seconds then self destructs
The app allows users to create an account to make and view reviews. The database for the application is parse.com.
Parse is currently in the process of being terminated so how long it will work is down to that at the moment.The back end is not going to 
be replaced so when parse goes this will got the way of the dodo.
